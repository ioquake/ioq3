## What is in this fork?
- Documentation of the Quake codebase generated by Doxygen
- Collection of silly hacks in the `hacks/` directory.
- Scripts for easier server/client startup

## Programmer's Guide to the Quake III Engine: 

### Notes on Architecture:
- The Quake 3 server is under `game/`, and the client code is under `cgame/`
  and `ui/`
- `botlib/` is for Bot AI.

### Variable naming conventions:
- `typedef float vec_t`: variables that end in `_t` signify a typdef.
- `struct teamgame_s`: structs that end in `_s` signif a struct.

### Function naming conventions:
- Suffix `_r`: functions that end in `_r` signify that they are recursive.

### File naming conventions:
- `Prefix g_`: File is part of `game`, which is server-side code.
- `Prefix bg_`: Means 'both games', things shared by both the server game and client game. 
- `ai_main.c`:
- Prefix `be_ai`: The source file is part of `botlib` and deals
  with AI
- Prefix `be_aas`: Part of `botlib` and relates to the Area Awareness System ( how bots know to navigate a map)
- Prefix `cg_`: stands for "Client Game", meaning client-side game code.

### Botlib:
- Contains the code for Bot AI.
- Uses `LibVar` (`l_libvar.h` and `l_libvar.c') which contains the bot library
  variables.
